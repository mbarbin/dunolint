# dunolint

Welcome to the `dunolint` project! This is a work-in-progress tool designed to assist with managing and maintaining `dune` files in a monorepo setup. It's currently in the early stages of development and there's no published code at this point. I'm seeking feedback and early discussions to determine whether a project like this makes sense.

## Project Goals

The goal of `dunolint` is to check invariants in dune setup and assist with ergonomic issues, such as applying systematic changes across many dune files. It aims to support things like enabling instrumentation, configuring recurring lint or preprocess flags, sorting libraries alphabetically, and more.

## Current State

The code is currently in a rough state, serving as a buffer to experiment and iterate quickly. At this point, I'm uncertain whether to consider it as throwaway code or whether it would be worthwhile to refine the scope and user specifications for a project of this nature.

## Get Involved

I would love to hear your thoughts about the potential of `dunolint`. If you're interested in this project and would like to engage in discussions or provide feedback, please feel free to open an issue or a discussion in the GitHub space of the project.

I've also started a discussion about `dunolint` on the OCaml discuss forum. You can find the post [here](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/elevator-talks-a-glimpse-into-my-ocaml-side-projects-dev-tools/14770/3). Feel free to join the conversation and share your thoughts in the platform that suits you best!

Thank you for your interest in `dunolint`!
