The dunolint command line tool exposes a util to ease integration with editors.
We test it here while calling it from the shell.

By default the command reads from `stdin`.

  $ echo '(lang dune 3.17)' | dunolint tools lint-file
  Error: Cannot infer the file kind from the filename "stdin".
  Hint: You may override the filename with the flag [--filename].
  [123]

However, when using the command that way, the linted file kind won't be
inferred. The filename must end with a basename that indicates a supported mode.

  $ echo '(lang dune 3.17)' | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=dune-project
  (lang dune 3.17)

By default, the contents is auto-formatted.

  $ echo '(lang\n dune\n 3.17)' | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=dune-project
  (lang dune 3.17)

The formatting may however be disabled.

  $ echo '(lang\n dune\n 3.17)' \
  > | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=dune-project \
  >   --format-file=false
  (lang
   dune
   3.17)

We note here a point of potential confusion:

1. Dunolint ignores the toplevel stanzas that it does not parse.

The reason for this is to be future proof, and also because we are not going to
necessarily support 100% of dune construct in dunolint, leaving aside those that
offer little linting interest.

2. `dune format-dune-file` works regardless of whether it is called on file
`dune`, or `dune-project`.

What this means for our dunolint command is that a user may be confused into
thinking they have linted their file correctly, based on the fact that it is
correctly formatted, failing to realize that all stanzas are in fact ignored.

See for example:

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (library (name mylib)
  >  (libraries b c a))
  > EOF

Normally, this file would be linted correctly and we'd see the libraries being
re-ordered.

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries a b c))

However, when reading from `stdin` you have to be careful to select the correct
file kind:

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=dune
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries a b c))

Because the following invocation would not crash (per 1.) AND format your file
correct (per 2.) however its stanzas would not be linted.

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=dune-project
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries b c a))

The filename provided may be a relative path. When it is used as label only, it
does not have to exists on disk.

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=path/to/my/file/dune
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries a b c))

However, it shouldn't be an absolute path, unless it points to a path that is
within the current working directory.

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=/path/to/my/file/dune
  Error: Invalid absolute file path, must be within cwd.
  file: "/path/to/my/file/dune"
  cwd: "$TESTCASE_ROOT"
  [123]

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=$PWD/path/to/my/file/dune
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries a b c))

When the command fails to parse the file, it complains and exits with a non-zero
code. This should be handled by the logic responsible for the editor
integration.

  $ echo "(invalid sexp" | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=dune
  File "dune", line 2, characters 0-0:
  Error: unclosed parentheses at end of input
  [123]

Next we are going to test the command with config.

The command may be passed a config file.

  $ echo '((rules ()))' > .dunolint

  $ dunolint tools lint dune --config=.dunolint
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries a b c))

To make it easier to write in this test, we're generating an actual config from
an OCaml file.

  $ ./lint_file_config_gen.exe > .dunolint

  $ cat .dunolint
  ;; This file is generated by [bin/lint_file_gen_config.ml]. Do not edit!
  ((skip_subtree (cond (((path (glob .git/*)) skip_subtree))))
   (rules
    ((cond
      (((path (glob vendor/*)) return)
       (true (enforce (dune_project (name (equals foo)))))))
     (cond (((path (glob _build/*)) skip_subtree))))))

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (dune lang 3.17)
  > 
  > (name my_project_name)
  > EOF

Currently the behavior of the lint-file command is to not load config files on
its own. See below how the name of the project is not linted:

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune-project
  (dune lang 3.17)
  
  (name my_project_name)

However, you may supply a config to use. The test config enforces the project
name so its effect is visible in this test (it is changed to "foo"):

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune-project --config=.dunolint
  (dune lang 3.17)
  
  (name foo)

Supplying an absent file or an invalid one results in errors:

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune-project --config=unknown
  dunolint: option '--config': no 'unknown' file or directory
  Usage: dunolint tools lint-file [OPTION]â€¦ [FILE]
  Try 'dunolint tools lint-file --help' or 'dunolint --help' for more information.
  [124]

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune-project --config=dune-project 2>&1 | head -n 3
  Internal Error:
  (parse_error.ml.Parse_error
    ((position ((line 3) (col 0) (offset 18)))

The path that is used by the config is the filename supplied when it is
overridden. In particular note how here we are executing the `return` statement
of the config.

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune-project --config=.dunolint \
  >   --filename=vendor/dune-project
  (dune lang 3.17)
  
  (name my_project_name)

If the file is at a path configured to be in a skipped directory, the command
won't apply linting rules to it.

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=.git/dune
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries a b c))

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=.git/dune --config=.dunolint
  (library (name mylib)
   (libraries b c a))

Note however that the result is currently different when the `skip_subtree` is
returned from a rule, rather than from the dedicated section. This is probably
confusing and we may revisit this later. Keeping as a regression test for now.

  $ cat dune | dunolint tools lint-file --filename=_build/dune --config=.dunolint
  (library
   (name mylib)
   (libraries b c a))

It is also possible to pass invariants directly to the command from the command
line.

  $ dunolint tools lint-file dune-project --enforce='(dune_project (name (equals bar)))'
  (dune lang 3.17)
  
  (name bar)
