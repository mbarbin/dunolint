The dunolint command line tool comes with a util to enforce conditions
interactively from the terminal.

  $ dunolint lint

Let's add some files.

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (name main)
  > EOF

  $ mkdir subrepo

  $ cat > subrepo/dune-project <<EOF
  > (name subrepo)
  > 
  > (generate_opam_files)
  > EOF

  $ touch dune subrepo/dune

  $ dunolint lint --dry-run --enforce false
  File "dune-project", line 1, characters 0-11:
  1 | (name main)
      ^^^^^^^^^^^
  Error: Enforce Failure.
  The following condition does not hold: false
  Dunolint is able to suggest automatic modifications to satisfy linting rules
  when a strategy is implemented, however in this case there is none available.
  Hint: You need to attend and fix manually.
  
  File "subrepo/dune-project", line 1, characters 0-14:
  1 | (name subrepo)
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Error: Enforce Failure.

  $ dunolint lint --dry-run --enforce '(dune_project (name (is_prefix sub)))'
  dry-run: Would edit file "dune-project":

Let's exercise cases where the sexp supplied is invalid.

  $ dunolint lint --dry-run --enforce '(blah'
  dunolint: option '--enforce': (parse_error.ml.Parse_error
              ((position ((line 1) (col 5) (offset 5)))
                (message "unclosed parentheses at end of input")))
  Usage: dunolint lint [OPTION]â€¦
  Try 'dunolint lint --help' or 'dunolint --help' for more information.

We hide the output of this one because it contains an unstable file path.

  $ dunolint lint --dry-run --enforce '(blah)' 2> /dev/null
