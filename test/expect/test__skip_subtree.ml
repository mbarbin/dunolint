(* This test covers the evaluation of the [path.equals] predicate. We cover two
   different execution context for it:

   1. From within the [skip_subtree] config section. In this case, the paths
   that are applied to the [path] selector are the directory paths of the
   directory that are being visited. Thus, the path ends with a '/' character.

   2. From within the rules. In this case, the path evaluated is the path of the
   file that is linted, thus would have a basename of [dune-project] or [dune].
   It is the complete relative path from the root of the repository. *)

  (* This test shows a difference between v0's skip_subtree and v1's skip_paths
     semantic, and in particular in a cases that involves the glob "**".

     As seen in the glob test below "**" does not match the empty relative path.
     With [v0] we are only testing the glob conditions of [skip_subtree] on
     directories, thus with v0 we see that the directory in question is not
     skipped and thus we see a diff. Whereas with [v1] the [skip_paths]
     constructs are also applied on individual files, and thus the file
     [dune-project] in this directory gets skipped.

     mbarbin: This case confused me during a debug session, thus I was inclined
     to keep it as documentation and regression test. *)
