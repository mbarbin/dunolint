val root : Absolute_path.t option Command.Arg.t

(** When supplying path arguments that are aimed to designate paths in
    workspace, we need to resolve them according to where the [workspace_root]
    is in relation to the cwd. We interpret relative paths as relative to the
    [cwd] from which the program started. We use this helper for example to
    resolve arguments such as [--below _] or [--config _]. *)
