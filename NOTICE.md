## A note about Blang

We vendored the module `Core.Blang` from the [Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core) project. `Core` is released under `MIT`, with minor changes to simplify dependencies.

### Notice

The files we imported are in `src/dunolint-lib/vendor/blang`. We've added a notice in the files and a comment next to the code that was copied and modified, which includes `Core`'s original LICENSE, which is included in this repo at `third-party-license/janestreet/core/LICENSE.md`.
